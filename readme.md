# roundr messaging application

Hello, this is sample web app that I created using node.js. 
This is just a test web app so that I could just apply what I learned and this is still not fully finalize but it works :>


## What I used
* Node.js
* Express for server instantation
* express-session, passport for authentication
* mongodb for database
* socket.io for realtime update
* bcrypt for hashing

## Troubles encountered
* my favourite problem in here is that, when a user sends a message, all other user also sends that user's message :>>> --->>(fixed)
* time is not right, I tried using time api's but the time is wrong when in production, but when in local server, it is right --->>(fixed) thanks to Krishna from slack in FrontEndMentor^

### Installation

```sh
$ npm install
```
Run app

```sh
$ npm start
```

I will still update this and continue learning :)
